title: About Me

I'm a software engineer in Austin, Texas. I graduate high school in May 2024, and plan to continue studying computer science in college.

I've been teaching myself to code since the beginning of the Pandemic in March of 2020. I originally taught myself Game Development, but have recently been moving into web development.

You can read about what I've built on the [home page](/)

# Professionalism
I strive to be a software professional. This means:
- I write tests
- I mercilessly refactor my code
- I maintain proper CI/CD pipelines
- I never stop learning

The books *The Clean Coder*, *The Three Body Problem*, *The Pragmatic Programmer*, *Algorithms to Live By*, and *Atomic Habits* have all had a great influence on me.
