Now that you have everything installed from [the last section](/posts/js-chapter0), we can actually get started. This section will cover variables, comments, and operators.

# Variables
Consider the following program:
```js
let myVariable = 17

console.log(myvariable)
```
The output would be:
```
17
```

This program defines two variables - `myage` and `myname`. You can imagine variables as "boxes" that contain a value. Variables are defined with following syntax:
```
let <name-of-variable> = <initial-value>
```
Variables cannot contain spaces in them, so you can use underscores_between_your_words or writeYourWordInCamelCase. camelCase is typically condiered the "correct" style, so I'd recommend sticking to that.

(Note: you may see the keyword `var` used to define variables. This is a holdover from earlier versions of javascript, and has some weirdness to it that we'll learn about later)

# Operators
Javascript has lots of operators to change variables, here's a quick demonstration:
```js
let num1 = 10
let num2 = 10
let num3 = 10
let num4 = 10
let num5 = 10
let num6 = 2

num1 = num1 + 5
num2 = num2 - 5
num3 = num3 * 5
num4 = num4 / 5
num5 = num5 % 3
num6 = num6 ** 3

console.log(num1);
console.log(num2);
console.log(num3);
console.log(num4);
console.log(num5);
console.log(num6);
```
You would get:
```
15
10
50
2
1
8
```
You can also shortcut this with:
```js
num1 += 5
num2 -= 5
num3 *= 5
num4 /= 5
num5 %= 3
num6 **= 3
```


Most of those are fairly self explanatory. The only one that might come as a suprise is the %. The % operator is called the "modulo" operator. Props to your math teacher if you already know about the modulo operator. It essentially just does division, but returns the remainder. This is useful for figuring out if a number is divisible by something:
```js
console.log(10 % 5)
```
Would output:
```
0
```
Since it outputted 0, that means there was no remainder to 10 / 5, and therefore 10 is divisible by 5. 


You can also do complex stuff with parenthesis:
```js
console.log(20*(2+4))
```

# Comments
Comments allow you to put notes in your code for your future self or another programmer.
```js
let myVariable = "Hello World" // a double slash puts a comment for the rest of the line
/*
  You can do long multiline comments like this
  They are typically used for jsDoc functions, which we'll talk about later
*/

/*
  You should use comments to vent your anger, because code with 
  swearing has higher code quality.

*/

```
It's good practice to put comments throughout your code to help out your future self. People say a lot of things about how much/what/why you should add comments. In my opion, follow [these rules](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/12/23/best-practices-for-writing-code-comments/) (although don't worry if you don't know what this article is talking about sometimes).


# Strings
So far we've only discussed variables as numbers, but they can also be strings! A string is basically just a word. For example:
```js
let myName = "Jonathan"

console.log(myname)
```
You can either use "" or '' around a word to describe it as a string. 
(actually, you can also use ``, but that does something different we'll discuss that) 

Strings also have a "concatenation" operator with the + sign:
```js
let hello = "Hello"
let world = "World"

console.log(hello + " " + world)
```
This will output:
```
Hello World
```

# Booleans
Booleans are really simple. They're just true or false.
```js
let myBoolean = true
let myOtherBoolean = false
```
To get the inverse of a boolean, you use `!`:
```js
let trueBoolean = true
console.log(!trueBoolean)
```
Outputs:
```
false
```
You can think of `!` as translating to "not"

# `const` variables
You may see variables defined with `const` before. `const` does the same thing let does, but makes the variable *immutable*, meaning that it can't be redefined later.
```js
const meaningOfLife = 42

meaningOfLife = 2 // Your code will crash here
```
You should use `const` by default, and only use `let` if you know a variable will change.

### A note on floats vs ints
Javascript just has one type for numbers- that being the number type. Most languages have two different types (some with varients of those two), those being `floats` and `ints`. `ints` are integers, meaning they cannot be decimals, while `floats` are floating point numbers


# Challenge
Write a program that does the following before moving onto the next chapter:
- declares a variable as a number
- Adds 2 to that number
- Multipes that number by another variable
- Says "Hello, {Your name}", where your name is a string variable
