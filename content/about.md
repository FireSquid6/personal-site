I'm a programmer from Austin, Texas. I'm self-taught and self-motivated to work on my own projects, however I'm also interested in joining teams of people. Aside from Game Development, I'm also a proficient web developer. I took [fireship.io](https://fireship.io)'s course on [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), and am capable of using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for static websites. If needed, I can quickly learn most concepts. My weakpoints are in GPU programming and networking, while I'm most confident in program architecture and gameplay programming.  
  
I started learning Gamemaker in 2020 during the quarantine, and have continued my journey into game development. I eventually learned Godot and Unity in 2021 and 2022 (Godot is still my favorite) and have been working on web development and teaching myself data science. I'm interested in Nerual Networks, and hope to eventually learn that.  
  
Unrelated, but I used to be a mid-level competitive Splatoon 2 player from 2018-2021. I played on the teams Cephalogods, Bread Gang, and Eclipse Gaming before quitting in 2021 to focus on learning programming.
