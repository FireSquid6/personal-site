# The Project
In late may, I began what at the moment has been my largest project undertaking. The plan was to build a webapp for competitive splatoon players to play matches against each other. I purchased a domain, created a twitter accoun, created a discord server, and started recuriting users. This, however, was a mistake. I knew the requiresments, but there were still plenty of questions on how I would actually build the thing.  

How would I deal with modeling users in teams?  
How would I deal with complicated state management?    
I'm gonna be gone in Europe for the last two thirds of June. Can I still complete the project?  

Ultimately, the answers to these questions ended up being "painfully," "poorly," and "not really." However it took me until July 2 (the time of writing this) to realize this. I'm in way over my head.  

The same thing happened to me when I first started out learning game development. I would always end up taking projects that were way harder than I originally thought, have to scale back, and either end up with a failed project or a 

It sucks to admit but this result comes from hubris. I always assume that I'll "just figure out" whatever new things I need to learn, and any complex problems that arise will collapse due to my ingenuity. Learning isn't frictionless.

If anything, I'm glad to have learned this lesson when I'm a 17 year old developer with only one year of experience, rather than being employed and losing my company thousands or evem millions of dollars.

# How I Plan to Learn
I have an idea for a notebook app. The requirements are as follows:
- The user can log in
- The user can create new notes
- The user can search through their existing notes

The challenges will be in the text search (I've never done that before) and making the UI clean. I plan on also using SvelteKit to build this application, while keeping with supabase on the backend.

# My New Rule
I will not make any commitments until I understand all technologies I am responsible for in the project. I will never assume my learning pace.
