As of May 2024, my programming knowledge is actually quite low. I've spent the past four years in high school exploring lots of domains- from front-end with react to back-end with elysia and bun as well as some game development. However, my knowledge is almost entirely surface level. I can use HTTP requests and even build an API but I have no clue how it actually works. I can use Godot to make simple online games, but could never implement a game engine myself. I would like to fix this. My reasons are:

1. Most programming worth doing is hard. If I have practice doing hard things, even if they have already been done before, that experience will transfer to other projects
2. I don't have any good project ideas that are new that I can actually build
3. I have four more years of college. I think it wouldn't hurt to spend one of them on stuff that may not look as good on my resume, but will allow me to succeed more at internships
4. I want to be a very solid programmer in Go, Typescript, and C


# The Projects
I thought up several projects I'd like to build over the next year (From May 2024 - May 2025). After that, I'll keep a working list of projects ideas I've had and consider working on one of those or getting an internship. Here are the projects (I stole some of them from codecrafters):

- An http server library in go implemented from the ground up (built in TCP library) inspired by bun's elysia
- My own implementation of a version control system
- A better version of a tool called "scratch" I made a while ago that allows you to easily create projects and code "scratchpads" to test new ideas
- My own implementation of curl
- An online spreadsheet application. Not sure what the scope of this is yet.
- A chat application like discord
- An interpreter for a shell called the "do shell" which acts as a "neater" language you could use instead of the sometimes clumsy feeling bash
- My own implementation of a docker container system
- My own operating system from scratch
- My own linux distribution from scratch
- An implementation of an SQL database (maybe like SQLite?)
- A tiling window manager
- neovim plugin for browsing files easier
- A custom modal text editor like vim

# Why these projects?
They roughly fall into several categories:
- build a tool I regularly use to learn more about it (sqlite database, http library, git, docker, linux distro). I'm not expecting these projects to actually be useful
- build an application to solve a minor annoyance I have (scratch, do shell)
- do something that right now scares me (spreadsheet application, messaging application, my own operating system)
- do something that I just think would be fun (tiling window manager, custom modal text editor)


# My Schedule
Over the next year, I'd like to spend each month building a few of these projects:

- **May 2024**
  - http server library for go
  - better version of scratch
- **June 2024**
    - Do shell interpreter
    - curl implementation
- **July + August 2024**
    - Chat application
- **September 2024**
    - Implementation of Git
    - My own container system like docker
- **October 2024**
    - Spreadsheet application
- **November 2024**
    - My own operating system
    - Neovim plugin for file browing based on a graph
- **December 2024**
    - Build my own linux distribution from scratch
- **January 2025**
    - An SQL Database implementation similar to SQLite
- **February 2025**
    - A tiling window manager 
- **March 2025**
    - A modal text editor like vim

Some other things I could throw in if I have time:
- an implementation of a cache like redis
- a drawing tool
